# DeepLearning-Short Projects

Welcome to "DeepLearning-Short Projects" â€“ your go-to repository for quick and simple Deep Learning projects. Whether you're new to AI or looking to sharpen your skills, these projects are designed to provide practical experience with Deep Learning concepts in an easy-to-digest format.

Most of the projects in this repository are part of my assignments for the "24-788 Deep Learning for Engineers" course at Carnegie Mellon University.
